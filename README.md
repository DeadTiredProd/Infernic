# Infernic Firmware

![machine_image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3163748-d6a7-42bf-ac57-e4a549a5c4b1)

# Infernic is the custom firmware behind a purpose-built machine for controlling a Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) heater, designed for soldering tasks with a maximum plate temperature of 300‚ÄØ¬∞C. It runs on an ESP32 38-pin Dev Module, coordinated by a Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) acting as the host.

The firmware implements PID-based heater control, starting with basic bang-bang logic and transitioning to PWM for fine-tuned precision. The heating element is regulated through a solid-state relay (SSR). The Raspberry Pi communicates with the ESP32 via a web-based interface, accessible from any device on the same network.

üì° Features and Monitoring
The firmware provides real-time data reporting, including:

Plate temperature

Lid temperature

Internal humidity

PWM and duty cycle percentage

Power consumption in watts

Average wattage over time

Most non-electronic components ‚Äî such as the outer enclosure and mounts ‚Äî are 3D-printed for cost-efficiency and easy customization.

üñ•Ô∏è Web UI Overview
The user interface offers a real-time temperature graph and system dashboard that includes:

Plate and lid temperature readings

Duty cycle and PWM output

Humidity tracking

Average power usage

This gives a clear view of the system‚Äôs performance for both short- and long-term monitoring.

üñºÔ∏è Visual Board Detection
As of July 2nd, 2025, the system includes a bitmap-based visual processing module. Images are converted to black and white for lightweight detection tasks. This feature is currently used to visually detect when a board has been placed on the heating plate ‚Äî primarily for monitoring and logging purposes, not for active control.
